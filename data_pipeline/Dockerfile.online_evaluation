# --- Configuration Notes for Runtime ---
# 1. GITHUB_TOKEN: Must be passed as an environment variable during `docker run`.
#    Example: `docker run -e GITHUB_TOKEN=$GITHUB_TOKEN ...`
#
# 2. Config File: Mount your config.yaml.
#    Example: `docker run -v /path/to/your/config.yaml:/app/config.yaml ...`
#
# 3. Handoff Storage: The path defined in `config.yaml` for `online_evaluation.handoff_storage_path`
#    must be a volume mounted into the container.
#    Example: If config.yaml has `handoff_storage_path: /mnt/handoff`,
#             then run `docker run -v /path/to/host/handoff_dir:/mnt/handoff ...`
#
# 4. Intermediate Directory: The script uses a default, but it will be inside the container.
#    If you need to inspect it and don't use --debug (which keeps it), it will be ephemeral.

# Set the entrypoint to run the online evaluation script
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "run_online_evaluation.py"]

# CMD specifies default arguments for the entrypoint.
# The --pr-identifier is mandatory and MUST be provided by the user at runtime.
# Example: docker run <image_name> --pr-identifier "owner/repo/123"
# Other arguments like --config can be overridden if needed.
